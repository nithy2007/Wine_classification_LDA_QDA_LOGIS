# Wine_classification_LDA_QDA_LOGIS
Classification of linearly separable data


Wine Classification

This project demonstrates multiclass classification on the classic Wine dataset from sklearn.datasets.
The performance of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and Multinomial Logistic Regression is compared in classifying different types of wine based on their chemical properties.

Project Overview

The Wine dataset consists of 178 samples of wine classified into three categories. Each sample contains 13 numerical features such as alcohol content, malic acid, color intensity, and proline concentration.

The goal of this project is to:

  - Load and explore the Wine dataset
  - Split it into training and testing sets
  - Train and evaluate three classification models:
    
      - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
      - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
      - Multinomial Logistic Regression
  - Compare their performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices
